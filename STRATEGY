1.	Grab links to all stories from http://slashdot.org/archive.pl?op=bytime.

	Each story will generate a URL like

		http://yro.slashdot.org/story/14/02/02/224229/press-used-to-print-millions-of-us-banknotes-seized-in-quebec


2. 	For now, retrieve all comments in D1 (classic discussion system) style.
	Why? Because it doesn't require Javascript manipulation to do a good job.

	We will browse at -1 threshold, threaded mode, oldest first.

	D1's URL follows the following pattern:

		http://{SUBDOMAIN}.slashdot.org/comments.pl?threshold=-1&mode=thread&commentsort=0&sid=STORY_ID

	where STORY_ID is in a hidden field named sid on the story page.
	(They'll have to be extracted.)

3.	Each page of comments has further links:
	
		a. comments deeper in the discussion thread
		b. permalinks to each comment

	Both links must also be crawled and saved.

	For 3(a), we need to look for links that have a pid parameter in them,
	save those pages, and save permalink pages for each comment.
	For 3(b), we need to save the permalink pages to each comment.
